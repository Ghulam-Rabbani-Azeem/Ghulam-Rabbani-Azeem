# 🌟 Welcome to My GitHub! 🌟

I'm a **DevOps and Cloud Infrastructure Engineer** with a passion for creating scalable, reliable, and efficient systems. My expertise lies in building CI/CD pipelines, managing cloud environments, and automating infrastructure to support high-performing development teams.

Currently, I'm pursuing a **Master's in Data Science**, which allows me to blend my technical skills in infrastructure with the power of data-driven insights. My experience spans across:

- **DevOps**: Crafting seamless CI/CD workflows, containerization (Docker/Kubernetes), and infrastructure-as-code (Terraform/CloudFormation).  
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Expertise in AWS, Azure, and GCP, with a focus on security, scalability, and cost optimization.  
- **Data Science**: Proficient in Python, data visualization, and building machine learning models to solve real-world problems.

🚀 I'm always excited to collaborate on innovative projects, contribute to open-source, and learn from this amazing developer community.
