# About Me

I’m an AI/ML Engineer with a passion for building and deploying intelligent software applications. I specialize in Generative AI, NLP, and cloud-based AI solutions, with hands-on experience in designing, developing, and deploying AI-powered systems. My work focuses on creating scalable, efficient, and production-ready AI applications that solve real-world problems.

Some highlights of my work include:

Building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models to improve search relevance and reduce AI-generated errors.

Developing AI-driven tools for object detection, risk analysis, and flood prediction.

Optimizing AI workflows using MLOps pipelines and cloud platforms like Azure, reducing inference latency by 30%.

I’m currently pursuing my MSc in Data Science at FAU Erlangen-Nürnberg, where I’m diving deeper into AI and machine learning. When I’m not coding, I enjoy exploring new ways to apply AI to solve complex challenges.

🚀 I'm always excited to collaborate on innovative projects, contribute to open-source, and learn from this amazing developer community.
