# About Me

I'm a **DevOps and Cloud Infrastructure Engineer** with a passion for creating scalable, reliable, and efficient systems. My expertise lies in building CI/CD pipelines, managing cloud environments, and automating infrastructure to support high-performing development teams.

Currently, I'm pursuing a **Master's in Data Science**, which allows me to blend my technical skills in infrastructure with the power of data-driven insights. My experience spans across:

- **DevOps**: Crafting seamless CI/CD workflows, containerization (Docker/Kubernetes), and infrastructure-as-code (Terraform/CloudFormation).  
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Expertise in AWS, Azure, and GCP, with a focus on security, scalability, and cost optimization.  
- **Data Science**: Proficient in machine learning, time-series forecasting, and big data technologies.

🚀 **What I Do**:

Optimize cloud infrastructure using predictive analytics and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Develop AI-powered tools for anomaly detection, log analysis, and resource optimization.

Build end-to-end data pipelines for preprocessing and real-time analytics.

🚀 I'm always excited to collaborate on innovative projects, contribute to open-source, and learn from this amazing developer community.
